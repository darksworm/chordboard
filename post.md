# ChordBoard: A Simple Yet Powerful Tool for Guitar Players

Hey r/Guitar!

I wanted to share a web app I've been working on that might be useful for many of you. It's called **ChordBoard** - a simple, interactive board for organizing and visualizing guitar chords.

## What is ChordBoard?

ChordBoard is a web application that lets you create your own custom chord charts. Think of it as a digital version of those chord sheets we all used to print out or scribble in notebooks, but with some neat interactive features.

## Key Features:

### ðŸŽ¸ Add and Arrange Chords
- Search for any chord by name (Am, F#maj7, etc.)
- Add chords to a grid-based board
- Drag and drop to rearrange chords however you want
- Organize chords into columns for verses, choruses, or different songs

### ðŸ‘† Multiple Fingering Options
- Each chord comes with multiple fingering positions to choose from
- Navigate between different fingerings with simple arrow buttons
- Find the fingering that works best for your playing style or song context
- See clear, visual chord diagrams with finger positions

### ðŸ’¾ Automatic Saving
- Your chord arrangements are automatically saved in your browser
- Close the page and come back later - your chords will still be there!
- No need to create an account or log in

## How I Use It

I personally use ChordBoard to:
- Work out song progressions
- Practice chord transitions by arranging chords in sequence
- Create custom chord sheets for songs I'm learning
- Experiment with different voicings and fingerings

## Try It Out!

The interface is super intuitive - just add chords, drag them around, and experiment with different fingerings. Your changes are saved automatically, so you can close the browser and come back to your chord arrangements later.

What chord progressions or songs are you working on right now? ChordBoard might help you visualize and practice them more effectively!

Let me know what you think or if you have any questions!
