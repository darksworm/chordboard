# Rules
- Let's use typescript with strict types;
- Avoid `any` at all costs;
- Write the code as simple as possible, prefer repetition to abstraction;
- For put everything into few constructs and files, and we will refactor later.
- Use `const` and `let` instead of `var`;
- Use `===` and `!==` instead of `==` and `!=`;
- Don't write tests unless explicitly asked for;
- Don't write comments unless the intent of the code is opaque;
- Prefer separating "business logic" from the "presentation logic" (e.g. in React, prefer separating the component from the business logic);
- Prefer using functional programming over OOP;
