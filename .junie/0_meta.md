Welcome to the documentation entrypoint for the ChordBoard project.

# Directory
[]: # .junie
[]: # ├── 0_meta.md -> entrypoint for documentation, contains rules for documentation structure (this file)
[]: # ├── 1_mission.md -> what & why we are building
[]: # ├── 2_features.md -> documentation of implemented and approved features
[]: # ├── 3_coding.md -> coding style and rules
[]: # ├── 4_structure.md -> high level structure of the code, use to locate code
[]: # └── 9_status.md -> high level description of the current work / feature in progress

## Rules
- Don't put features in '2_features.md' that are not approved yet, or are in progress. Those should be placed in 9_status.md
- As they are approved, document them in `2_features.md` with a description of the most important aspects of the feature (what and why)
- Document a high level structure of the code in `4_structure.md` - this should include a max
  one sentence summary for each construct - this is supposed to act as a directory or map of the code so that you can more
  easily find direction in the future
